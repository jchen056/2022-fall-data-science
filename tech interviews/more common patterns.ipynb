    "# Sliding window \n",
    "another common approach to solving problems related to arrays. Interestingly, a sliding window is actually implemented using two-pointers!\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the sliding window technique is to efficiently find the \"best\" window that fits some constraint. Usually, the problem description will define what makes a window \"better\" (shorter length, larger sum etc.) and the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that a problem wanted the length of the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to k for an array with positive numbers. In this case, the constraint is sum(window) <= k, and the longer the window, the better it is. The general algorithm behind sliding window is:\n",
    "1. Define a pointer for the left and right bound that represents the current window, usually both of them starting at 0.\n",
    "2. Iterate over the array with the right bound to \"add\" elements to the window.\n",
    "3. Whenever the constraint is broken, in this example if the sum of the window exceeds k, then \"remove\" elements from the window by incrementing the left bound until the condition is satisfied again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k, find the length of the longest subarray whose sum is less than or equal to k."
